warden-cookbook
===============

A cookbook to install Cloud Foundry's Warden as a standalone component.

### Credit / History

This cookbook was originally a port of [vagrant-warden](https://github.com/silas/vagrant-warden) by @silas . The original vagrant project uses Puppet for the provisioner, but I felt more comfortable w/ Chef so I ported it.
